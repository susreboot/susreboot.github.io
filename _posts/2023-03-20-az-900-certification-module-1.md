**Cloud Computing**

- Cloud computing is a¬† delivery model for services like the following. There are many other services but these are the 4 covered on the AZ-900 Exam. All these services are delivered over the internet.

- Storage
    - Files ‚Äì Store of business data in the could (aka files)
    
    - Databases ‚Äì Azure offer fully managed relational, NoSQL, and in-memory databases. These databases can span from proprietary and open-source engines and are determined by the needs of a developer.

- Compute Power
    - Virtual Machines (Linux/Windows/Containers)

- Networking
    - Secure networking between cloud components
    
    - Networking with business network

- Analytics
    - Performance Data ‚Äì Periodically collected numeric data relating to the performance of a device or a component of the device.
    
    - Telemetry - The measurement of data (electrical or physical) and remote transmission of this data.

**Scalability**

- Scalability is the ability to "scale". Scaling is the process of;
    - Allocating (adding) resources
    
    - Deallocating (removing) resources

- Vertical Scaling ‚Äì Increasing resources (CPU/RAM/GPU/STORAGE/NETWORK BANDWIDTH) up or down to meet the needs of the virtual service function (hence the name "vertical" ‚Üë‚Üì )
    - Scaling up (‚Üë) ‚Äì Increasing resources to meet the virtual services need.
    
    - Scaling down (‚Üì)‚Äì Decreasing resources to match the needs of the virtual service.

- Horizontal Scaling (‚Üî) ‚Äì Adding similar machines to equally distribute the service workload across machines. This can be increased or decreased on a need basis and can also occur automatically.
    - Scaling out (‚Üí) - Increasing the amount of resources/instances needed for virtual services.
    
    - Scaling in (‚Üê) - Decreasing the amount of resources/instances needed for virtual services.

**Elasticity**¬†

- Elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically to match resources sufficient for the given virtual service/workload. If **scaling** is happening quickly, it is referred to as **Elasticity.**

**Agility**

- ¬†There are two ways to allocate resources in the cloud; manually or automatically (using scripting).¬† Regardless of the chosen method of allocation/deallocation, with agility the ability to allocate and deallocate resources to scale can be done quickly based on the environment or business needs.

**Fault Tolerance**

- Fault tolerance is the ability to remain up and running during component and service failures. Maintaining no single point of failure within the datacenter, preventing the chance of a virtual service failure.
    - Fail-overs - A plan to shift traffic to a redundant system in case the primary system fails.
        - A common example of a fail-over with a database would be; having two systems, with the second system containing a copy of the database. All ongoing changes would be synced to this second database system and would not be in-use until a fail-over is triggered and the secondary machine would take over the job of the primary machine (becoming the primary machine).
        
        - **Azure Traffic Manager** (a DNS-based traffic balancer) can be used to fail-over from a failing primary system to a stand-by secondary system.

**Disaster**

- A disaster is a serious disruption of services caused by natural or human-induced causes/errors.

**Disaster Recovery (DR)**

- Disaster Recovery is the ability to recover from an event that has taken down a virtual service or region (a disaster).
    - A basic Disaster Recover for Azure would be to create two instances of a virtual service in separate regions (aka separate datacenters) and setting up replication between the two regions.
        - In front of these two replicated instances, DNS routing should be configured for the user to be automatically transferred to the secondary DR site in the event of disaster.¬†

**High Availability (HA)**

- High Availability (HA) is the ability to jeep services running for extended periods of time with very little downtime.
    - Availability can be calculated by Year, Month, or day and uses the formula:
        - MTBF (uptime) - **M**ean **T**ime **B**etween **F**ailure
        
        - MTTR (downtime) - **M**ean **T**ime **T**o **R**epair
            - **Availability =** Uptime(MTBF)/ uptime(MTBF) + downtime(MTTR) \* 100% = **X%**
